# PIC32-Humans-vs-Zombies
Welcome to Leoul Yiheyisâ€™ Lab 4, Human vs Zombie! This is a very
simple game that highlights the usefulness and ingenuity of the Pmod
ADXL accelerator. Once you start the game, you will encounter the
Splash Screen, which will appear for 5 seconds. After, you can pick
the time needed to win at the Options screen. Press Buttons 1 & 2 to
increment/decrement, and use Button 3 to advance to the game.
Once in the game, the human is the white stick man, while the zombie
is the skull and bones slowly moving across the screen. There are two
speeds for every direction, a normal speed and a fast speed. You can
access these speeds by changing the tilt of the ADXL 345. The zombie
only moves at a set, slower pace so it should not be that hard running
away from him :)
You win by staying alive for the time you chose on the Options screen.
You lose if the zombie catches you! I hope you like the added
animation on the win & lose screens.

Enjoy the game!
